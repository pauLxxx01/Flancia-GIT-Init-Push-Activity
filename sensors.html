	<h1>Understanding Sensors</h1>
	<p>Sensors are devices that detect and respond to some type of input from the physical environment. They are used in many applications to enable advanced features like games that take the orientation or the acceleration of the device they run on into account.</p>
	<p>There are various types of sensors, such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, motion sensors, and many others. These sensors can be used to measure different aspects of the environment, providing valuable data for a wide range of applications.</p>
	<p>For example, a temperature sensor is designed to detect and measure temperature, while a motion sensor is used to detect movement in a specific area. Sensors play a crucial role in fields such as home automation, industrial control systems, healthcare, and environmental monitoring.</p>
	<p>By understanding the capabilities of sensors, we can harness their data to create innovative solutions that improve our lives and the world around us.</p>
