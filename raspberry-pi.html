<h1>The Meaning of Raspberry Pi</h1>
<p>Raspberry Pi is defined as a minicomputer the size of a credit card 
    that is interoperable with any input and output hardware device like a monitor,
    a television, a mouse, or a keyboard â€“ effectively converting the set-up 
    into a full-fledged PC at a low cost. </p>
<a>The first generation of computers came as massive processing
    systems built with vacuum tube technology. 
    Over the years, more compact and less expensive versions of what a 
    computer would come to look like sprung up.Today, we have minicomputer
     gadgets such as smartphones in our pockets. Even though computers 
     have become so commonplace, they are still not widely accessible 
     in developing countries. This imbalance in access to computers and 
     programming technology led to the development and creation of the 
     Raspberry Pi computer.
