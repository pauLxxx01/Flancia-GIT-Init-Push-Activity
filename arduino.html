	<h1>What is Arduino?</h1>
	<p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.</p>
	<p>Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.</p>
